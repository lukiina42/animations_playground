# Animations
Used this project to play around with css animations. The animations include:
 - Running hero pushing the toolbar out of the screen
 - A flamingo randomly sliding into the view from the bottom and watching your every step (cursor)
 - If the flamingo is annoying, you can choose to kill the flamingo with a sniper
 - Transitions
